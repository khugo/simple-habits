# Simple Habits

This is a simple habit tracker app for my personal use. It provides minimal functionality required by me: a calendar
view of the full year for each habit.

## Development

This is a supabase app. You need to have a supabase account and a project set up to run this app. The DB schema
is stored in the `supabase/migrations` directory.

To develop, just run `npm run dev`. This will connect to the production supabase instance.
